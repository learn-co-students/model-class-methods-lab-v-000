# AREL Lab

## Instructions

Get all the tests passing. Remember that some tests will require writing more than one method in more than
one model. Also, don't worry if you have trouble with this lab. Some of these are pretty
hard.

Keep in mind that this lab is focused primarily on ActiveRecord querying methods, and not the AREL library itself. The ActiveRecord::QueryMethods library is a small library that is based on the AREL library. Each querying method that you use will eventually translate into a AREL statement.
